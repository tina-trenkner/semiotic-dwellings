As part of the interview process for a news app developer job in New Zealand, I was asked to create a data viz based off of some housing data. I had to learn Semiotic (https://github.com/emeeks/semiotic) over the course of a weekend and upload the viz to a private repo. I have permission from the editor I was working with to show this repo, with names and some details omitted. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run the project, download the repo, cd into the folder semiotic-dwellings, then run: npm run. The bar chart should show at http://localhost:3000/

What I hope editors and devs can take from this project is that I am able to delve into docs, build something, and explain what I understood and what I would improve upon if provided the gift of more time and experience.
